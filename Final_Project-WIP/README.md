# Final Project

Course final project, of student's choice.

## Goal

Render a realistic looking tree.

Checklist:
- [x] Write Tree class that generates points based on L-system rules
- [x] Draw lines using the points generated
- [X] Use a Geometry Shader to calculate all the limbâ€™s cylindrical points from the reference frame
- [ ] Add lighting to the scene
- [ ] Use bump mapping to add a bark look to the tree

## Results

### Stick Tree
